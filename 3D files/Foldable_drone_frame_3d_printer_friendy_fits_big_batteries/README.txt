# Summary

I redesigned all parts except the lock file. Its diagonal size is aboout 45cm. 11 inch props are fitting. This model has much more space for bigger bateries like the turnigy 3s 5000mah. Unfortuatelly i needed to remove the front arm locking mechanism for that. I replaced it with 2 wingnuts in the front. The hole model is much more 3d printer friendly, since you dont need so much support material. The only problamatic parts are the front arms because they dont lay flat on the ground. I used PETG to print it, because my 3d hub recommended to you PETG instead of ABS. Hope you like it :)

changes i recommend you to do (i will do them when i have time)....

- remove the bolts from the lock file (you dont need them for this design). I also noticed not all pieces of the lock file are placed on the ground. You will have to fix that if you want to print it.
- remove landing stands from the backarms and add some to the back of the bottom plate (you will get much more impact resistance)
- change the design so your batterie fits perfectly in case you use a different one


following updates (included changes from above):

- redesign so a xiaomi yi with gimbal fits in the frame without long landing gear
- maybe replacement of the back mechanism for more durability
